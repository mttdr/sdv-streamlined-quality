# Regular Quality

Drop the quality level of most items in order to ease inventory management.

- Artisan goods are not impacted by this mod and always retain their quality
- Silver quality items are always downgraded to Regular quality (the sell price increase is not worth it)
- Iridium quality items are downgraded to Regular quality, but are doubled in quantity (in line with Vanilla game, where the sell price is double, also removes the dilemma of "is this worth selling now, or should I process it? now you can process double the quantity")
- Gold quality items are retained by default, but you can set what item categories should or should not be downgraded via the Mod Config Menu, with the possibility to set a price threshold (I do not care about about "gold quality" item that sells for very little)

## Installation

- Download the mod zip ->
	[GitHub](https://github.com/mttdr/sdv-streamlined-quality/releases),
	[Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/36894)
- Download and install [SMAPI](https://smapi.io/)
- Unzip the mod into Stardew Valley's Mods folder

## Configuration

Selected categories will be allowed to retain gold quality items (useful to complete community center bundles, win at the fair, give better gifts, etc...) the price threshold is useful if you want to ignore cheap items (no need to clutter the inventory!)

## Existing save

- All items are impacted by this mod only AFTER being moved to the player inventory, so you can try this mod or the various settings without the worry to downgrade any storaged items in your chests.
- The quality will not be dropped right away. The quality will be removed once you add items to your inventory.
- If you remove the mod, new items will have quality again. But already changed items will not be restored.

## Limitations:

- Item quality is adjusted only AFTER it has been added to the inventory.
	Because of this, you should always keep an inventory slot open to be able to pick up items.
