# Streamlined Quality Mod

A mod that I forked and heavily modified for the game [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/) utilizing [SMAPI](https://smapi.io/).

It can be downloaded from my [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/36894?tab=user+files)
or the [Releases](https://github.com/mttdr/sdv-streamlined-quality/releases) section of GitHub.
